# GitHub AI Workflow

This document explains the separation between **human activity** and **AI assistant activity** in GitHub.  
The goal is to ensure that authorship, attribution, and accountability remain transparent at every stage of the workflow.

---

## Document Chain

- **[GitHub App Setup](GitHub_App_Setup.md)**  
  How to create GitHub Apps in the GUI, generate PEM keys, and install them on repositories.  
  *(Skip this if your Apps are already created and installed.)*

- **[GitHub App Key Guide](GitHub_App_Key_Guide.md)**  
  Secure handling of `.pem` keys and environment variables for GitHub Apps.  
  *(Assumes you are familiar with the setup in the previous doc.)*

- **[GitHub App — GitHub API](GitHub_App_GitHub_API.md)**  
  How to use each App’s installation token with the GitHub CLI or direct API calls to open PRs and issues, ensuring attribution is clearly labeled by assistant.

## Next Steps
1. Start with [GitHub App Setup](GitHub_App_Setup.md) if you need to create Apps.  
2. Then proceed to [GitHub App Key Guide](GitHub_App_Key_Guide.md) for secure key storage and management.  
3. Finally, use [GitHub App — GitHub API](GitHub_App_GitHub_API.md) to perform PR/Issue actions with the Apps.
